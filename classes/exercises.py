# 1.1. Create a class, `Triangle`.
#
#    Its __init__() method should take `self`, `angle1`, `angle2`, and `angle3` as arguments.
#    Make sure to set these appropriately in the body of the `__init__()` method.

# 1.2. Create a `Triangle` class variable named `number_of_sides` and set it equal to 3.

# 1.3. Create a `Triangle` class method named `check_angles`
#
#    The sum of a triangle's three angles is It should return True if the sum of
#    `self.angle1`, `self.angle2`, and `self.angle3` is equal 180, and False otherwise.

# 1.5. Create a `Triangle` class method that receives the perimeter and calculates the length of each side
#      The side lengths should be returned in a set.

# 2. Create an `Equilateral` class that inherits from `Triangle`
#
#    This class doesn't need to receive any angle __init__,
#    because we already know that all of them should be 60.

# 2.1. Create a `Equilateral` class method that receives a side length and calculates the triangle area.
